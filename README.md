# PyGoogleDriveCompressor

**PyGoogleDriveCompressor** is a Python script that allows you to compress image files located in a Google Drive directory. It is designed to work seamlessly with Google Colab, and can be customized for various compression settings. The script ensures efficient image compression while keeping the quality intact. This project was 100% AI-generated.

## Installation

### Requirements
- Google Drive with the folder containing your images
- Google Colab or local Python environment
- `Pillow` library for image processing

### Steps to Use (via Google Colab)
1. **Mount Google Drive:**
   - Open Google Colab and run the following code to mount your Google Drive:
     ```python
     from google.colab import drive
     drive.mount('/content/drive')
     ```

2. **Upload the script to Google Colab:**
   - Copy the `PyGoogleDriveCompressor.py` script to your Google Drive and upload it to your Colab workspace.

3. **Run the Script:**
   - In Colab, run the following:
     ```python
     !python /content/drive/MyDrive/your_path/PyGoogleDriveCompressor.py
     ```
   - This will process the images in the specified directory.

4. **Check the Output:**
   - The script will show the compression results in the output and move original images to a separate folder (`originals_pictures`).

### Manual Installation (if not using Colab)
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PyGoogleDriveCompressor.git
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install Pillow
   ```

3. Run the script on your local machine:
   ```bash
   python PyGoogleDriveCompressor.py
   ```

## How It Works
The script works by:
- Searching for image files in a specified Google Drive directory.
- Checking if the file is already compressed (if the filename contains `_compressed`).
- Compressing the images if they are not already compressed and meet the size requirements.
- Moving the original files to a separate folder (`originals_pictures`).
